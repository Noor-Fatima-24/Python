# Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different thing

# Getting the Data Type
# You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
a = 23
b = "HEY"

print("Type of a is:", type(a))
print("Type of b is:", type(b))

# Assigning Values

a = 89        # int
b = 3.14      # float
c = "HEY"     # string
d = True      # boolean

# complex is a built-in data type used to represent complex numbers (numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part).

z = 3 + 5j    # complex
print(z)

n = complex(3, 5)   # same as 3+5j
print(n)       

print()


# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
print(20 + 5)
# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators
