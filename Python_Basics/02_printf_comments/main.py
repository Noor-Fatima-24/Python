# Day 2: Exploring print() and comments in Python

print("Welcome to Day 2 of my Python learning journey!")

# print() is a built-in Python function that instructs the computer to display text on the screen.


# this is a single line comment !
'''
this is multi line comment !

Anything after a # symbol is a comment. 
Python ignores comments, but they are useful for explaining code to human readers.
