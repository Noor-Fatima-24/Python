# creating a variable
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

print("welecome")
print("Vaiables")

# \n ---  next line (line break) 
# Always put \n inside single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ", because itâ€™s a string escape sequence.
print("welecome\nVariables")

print()          # prints a blank line

# syntax : variable_name = value
a = 100
d = "hello"
# assigning multiple value 
b = 20,30,50
c = "bye ","hi ","hey , dude"

print(a)
print(d)
print(b)
print(c)

# If you have a collection of values in a list, etc.
#  Python allows you to extract the values into variables. 
# This is called unpacking.
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
e = f = g = h = 23
print(e)
print(f)
print(g)
print(h)
